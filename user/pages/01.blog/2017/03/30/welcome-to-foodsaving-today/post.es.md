¡Hoy lanzamos nuestro sitio! El propósito es compartir noticias, información, anuncios y eventos de alrededor del mundo sobre el ahorro de alimentos. Para compartir e inspirar.

If you don't know anything about foodsaving: the aim is to prevent food from going to waste (try [this introduction](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/free-food-sharing-leftovers-surplus-local-popular) from The Guardian).

There are many people and projects trying to solve this now, with many different approaches - non-profit or profit, software or not, open source or proprietary, formal or informal, custom software or a patchwork of tools, community or business.

That's all for now, but stay tuned...
