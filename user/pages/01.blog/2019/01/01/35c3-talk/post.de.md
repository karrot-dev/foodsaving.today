2018 ended with a great opportunity for the [foodsaving worldwide team](https://foodsaving.world/team): We got accepted to hold a talk about what we do and why on the 35th annual [Chaos Communication Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress) - the biggest European hacker event with 16.000 people participating!

Nick, Tilmann and I (Janina) prepared a 30 minutes bit about the following topics:

- The extent of the global food waste scandal
- How traditional ways to counter it fail
- The method and success of foodsharing.de
- How it's spreading further and further
- The idea and basic features of Karrot
- How and why Karrot is made the way it is

You can watch it in the original English version or in a translated German one. Enjoy!
